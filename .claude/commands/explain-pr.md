# Explain PR Command

## Purpose

You are a PR summarizer. Given a PR reference, you produce a **concise,
human-readable explanation** of what changed and flag the most important
potential issues from both a **code** and **UI/UX** perspective. This is a
high-level briefing, not a line-by-line code review.

**Arguments**: `$ARGUMENTS` — the PR reference (PR number, full URL, or
branch name). If empty or ambiguous, ask the user once.

## Task

1. Resolve the PR reference and fetch its metadata, diff, and description
2. Skim the diff and changed files for context (don't read everything line by line)
3. Produce a **short** natural-language summary of what changed and why
4. Flag the most important **potential issues** — code AND UI/UX
5. Keep the whole response tight: a reader should grasp it in under a minute

## Execution Strategy

- **Fetch PR data** with `gh`:
    - `gh pr view <ref> --json number,title,author,baseRefName,headRefName,body,url,additions,deletions,changedFiles`
    - `gh pr diff <ref>` for the full diff
- **Skim, don't deep-dive**: read the diff and only open full files when a
  flagged issue genuinely needs surrounding context. Do not read every changed
  file end-to-end.
- **Parallel investigation (optional)**: for large PRs (>20 files), launch up
  to 3 `Explore` subagents in parallel — one focused on backend/data changes,
  one on frontend/UI changes, one on tests/config — then consolidate.
- **UI/UX focus**: pay attention to changes in `/src/components/`, route
  files, styling, accessibility, and interactive flows. Flag things like:
  missing React Query loading/error/empty states, inconsistent shadcn/Base UI
  component usage, jarring interactions, accessibility regressions, broken
  sonner toast patterns.
- **Code focus**: flag obvious correctness, security, performance, or
  convention issues — but stay high-level. Don't list every nit.

## Output Format

Keep the response **concise**. Use this structure:

```
## PR #<num>: <title> — <author>
<URL>

### What changed
2–5 sentences in plain English describing the change and the motivation.
Mention the main user-facing or behavioral impact, not file paths.

### Highlights
- Bullet list of the 3–6 most notable concrete changes (one line each)

### Potential issues — Code
- [severity] short description (file:line if specific)
- ...

### Potential issues — UI/UX
- [severity] short description
- ...

### Overall
One-line verdict: looks good / needs attention / risky.
```

**Severity tags**: `HIGH` / `MED` / `LOW`. If there are no issues in a
category, write "None spotted." — do not invent issues to fill space.

## Constraints

- **Read-only** — never edit or write files
- **Stay concise** — entire response should typically fit on one screen
- **No deep code walkthroughs** — this is a summary, not a tutorial
- **Don't list every file** — group and summarize
- **Don't flag pedantic nits** — focus on issues a reviewer would actually raise
- **Don't restate the PR description verbatim** — synthesize, don't quote
- Maximum of 3 parallel subagents

## Best Practices

- Lead with the _why_ (what user problem / goal the PR addresses), then the _what_
- Translate jargon into plain English where possible
- Prefer concrete UI/UX observations ("no empty state for filtered results",
  "missing React Query loading state", "error not shown to user via sonner toast")
  over generic ones ("consider UX")
- If the PR is tiny or trivial, say so — don't pad
- If the PR is huge or hard to summarize, say so honestly and focus on the
  most impactful changes
- When flagging an issue, give the reader enough to act on it (file/area +
  what's wrong) without a full diff dump
